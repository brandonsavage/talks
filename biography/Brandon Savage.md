##Long Bio
In 2003 Brandon discovered that PHP could automate things that would take a long time to do by hand. Brandon was hooked, and spent every waking hour learning PHP and how to use it for his projects. Brandon began his career working for small shops doing WordPress and Drupal with some custom applications, and then moved on to Mozilla, where he worked on a highly-available big-data project called Socorro.

Brandon's passions are object-oriented design and well-written code, along with a healthy dose of a "just ship" mentality for solving business problems. Brandon lives in Maryland and is a private pilot with more than 400 hours of total time. Brandon speaks at PHP conferences around the world on a variety of subjects focused on good code, object-oriented design, and being your own boss.
