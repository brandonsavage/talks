#Better Quality Through Code Review

##Short Description
Most developers recognize the value of code reviews, but making a code review process effective can be really difficult. Maybe you have a nitpicker on your team, or perhaps time constraints kill the review process early on in the cycle. Whatever the reason you're struggling, learn how you can make your code review process work better, improve the quality of your applications, and even improve the morale of your team!

##Long Description
One of the best quality control tools developers hold is the code review process. Having more than a single set of eyes on any code is a crucial element in developing a quality code base. But there are pitfalls, too: maybe you have a nitpicker on your team, or perhaps your process doesn't allow the time for good code reviews. You may be struggling to ship, worried that code reviews will eat the precious time you have for getting "real" work done. But many companies, especially Mozilla, have done code reviews for years, and still shipped on time. What are there secrets? Come find out!
