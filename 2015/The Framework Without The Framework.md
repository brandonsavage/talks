#The Framework Without The Framework

##Short Description
Developing a PHP application used to have a big decision up front: do I go with a major full-stack application framework or write everything myself? Smart developers chose the latter. But the advent of Composer for package management has turned this decision on its head. Now, rejecting a full-stack framework doesn't have to mean going it alone - there are thousands of packages to help you. Come learn how you can have the benefits of a framework without the constraints of the same, and how you can go truly framework free.
